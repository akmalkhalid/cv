Hi, I'm Akmal. I am an assistant professor in the [School of Information Science](https://www.jaist.ac.jp/english/areas/information-science.html) at the [Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (JAIST)](https://www.jaist.ac.jp) and a part-time Research Fellow in the [School of Computer Sciences](https://cs.usm.my) at the [Universiti Sains Malaysia](https://www.usm.my). My work specializes in artificial intelligence techniques such as evolutionary algorithms and decision support systems and game studies such as entertainment science and games informatics. My interests focus specifically on methods and developments in the fields of the entertainment technology and operational research, which covered topics of interest include but are not limited to manufacturing systems, advanced scheduling and planning, artificial intelligence techniques, game analytic and informatics, search algorithms, bio-inspired optimization techniques, and machine learning methods.

Current Work and Research
------
My current works revolve around the intersections of topics between AI, entertainment, and games studies.


Background and History
------
I received my Ph.D. from [School of Computer Sciences](https://cs.usm.my) at the [Universiti Sains Malaysia](https://www.usm.my) in 2018, my M.Sc. and B.Sc. in Computer Science, from [School of Computer Sciences](https://cs.usm.my) at the [Universiti Sains Malaysia](https://www.usm.my), in 2015 and 2013, respectively. My study specializes in computational intelligence, specifically on evolutionary computing techniques, in which I applied them in modeling and optimization domains. I have experience in cellular automata modeling, multi-agent systems, basic machine learning methods, intelligent search algorithms, and expert systems. I was also involved in organizational works such as organizing student workshops, postgraduate colloquiums, and educational talks.
